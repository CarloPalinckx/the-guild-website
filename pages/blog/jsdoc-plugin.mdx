With the release of the `@graphql-code-generator/jsdoc` plugin you can generate JSDoc type definitions based on your GraphQL schema. This can help you catch bugs and increases developer experience by gaining auto-completion in your editor. Let's see it in action:

> If you are not familiar with setting up graphql-code-generator yet. Have a look at these docs (link to docs) for more in-depth information on configuration.

To start using this plugin, we first have to install it.

In the case that you have have not installed any @graphql-code-generator plugins, run:
```
```

Or when you want to add jsdoc to your existing configuration, run:
```
```

Once installed, you can go ahead and stick this in your codegen configuration file
```
```

Now we are all set up, let's look at how we can generate us some types.

First we'll need a schema to interact with, we can do this by either passing a path to a schema file or a url into our config. For this example we'll use the public graphql pokemon api:

+- of config file.

Then, we can create a .graphql file that holds our query:

```
```

> Note that this version of the jsdoc plugin does not yet generate type definitions specifically for your queries or mutations, but we require at least 1 .graphql file to be present.

All set! Let's run the code generator:

```
```

This results in a bunch of generated docblocks that you can import and use to typecheck your javascript code!
